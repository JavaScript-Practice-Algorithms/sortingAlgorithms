//Quick sort works by first finding a pivot in the array and organizing the array based on the value of the pivot less than to the 'right' and greater than to the 'left' and then recusively calling untill the array is sorted
//this time we are going to make this a method available on the Array object
//Implement your version of quickSort below

Array.prototype.quickSort = function(){
  //Your code here
};
